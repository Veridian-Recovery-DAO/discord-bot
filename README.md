# Veridian Recovery DAO Discord Bot

## üöÄ Overview

Welcome to the Veridian Recovery DAO Discord Bot! This bot is designed to support the Veridian Recovery DAO community by providing tools and resources for addiction recovery. Key features include scheduling and listing recovery meetings, offering AI-powered psychoeducation and crisis intervention guidance, facilitating NFT purchases, interacting with the DAO's ERC20 token, and managing user account settings within the DAO.

The project consists of two main components:
1.  **[https://github.com/Veridian-Recovery-DAO/discord-bot.git](Discord Bot = TypeScript *this repository*):** Handles all Discord interactions, command processing, database interactions (MongoDB), and integrations with Thirdweb for NFT and token functionalities.
2.  **[https://github.com/Veridian-Recovery-DAO/llm-service.git](LLM Service - Python):** A separate FastAPI service that interfaces with a Large Language Model trained in recovery literature to provide psychoeducational support.
